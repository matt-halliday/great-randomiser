# The Great Randomiser

## Premise

We have a covers group during COVID 19 lockdown.
Each person in the group submits a song suggestion that they would like to hear covered.
The folks who submitted, each get a song to cover in return.

We take a little under two weeks per round to produce our track and then have a listening party via Zoom to have some beers and appreciate all the masterpieces.
